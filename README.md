# RN-Vision-Replication
RN-Vision-Replication is a faithful PyTorch implementation of the Relation Network (RN) vision architecture, following the original paper’s model design, mathematics, and block diagram. The project reproduces the full pipeline from image encoding to object representation and relational reasoning for visual question answering and reasoning tasks.
